# LootBoxCalculator
Calculates how many loot boxes it takes to find all items.

This project was more of a curiosity, it is currently set based on Path of Exile drop rates and items used in their Loot boxes.
Prompts user for how many boxes to open and displays how many boxes it took on average to obtain all items.
